# Project-Echo-Aid
Our goal is to help improve the daily lives of our healthcare heroes. Our mission is to create a device that allows for better communication within the COVID-19 frontlines between healthcare workers and their patients. The device we plan to build should allow the healthcare worker to be heard more clearly as they administer care to patients. The device itself is meant to amplify sound of the user speaking if the environment is too loud for the user to be heard at a normal speaking level. This will allow for improved communication between healthcare workers and their patients.
